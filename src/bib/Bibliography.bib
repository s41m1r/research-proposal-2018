As a result, many business processes leave their “footprints” in transactional information systems, i.e., business events are recorded in so-called event logs. Process mining aims at improving this by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from event logs, i.e., the basic idea of process mining is to diagnose business processes by mining event logs for knowledge. In this paper we focus on the potential use of process mining for measuring business alignment, i.e., comparing the real behavior of an information system or its users with the intended or expected behavior. We identify two ways to create and/or maintain the fit between business processes and supporting information systems: Delta analysis and conformance testing. Delta analysis compares the discovered model (i.e., an abstraction derived from the actual process) with some predefined processes model (e.g., the workflow model or reference model used to configure the system). Conformance testing attempts to quantify the “fit” between the event log and some predefined processes model. In this paper, we show that Delta analysis and conformance testing can be used to analyze business alignment as long as the actual events are logged and users have some control over the process.},

Business process mining takes these logs to discover process, control, data, organizational, and social structures. Although many researchers are developing new and more powerful process mining techniques and software vendors are incorporating these in their software, few of the more advanced process mining techniques have been tested on real-life processes. This paper describes the application of process mining in one of the provincial offices of the Dutch National Public Works Department, responsible for the construction and maintenance of the road and water infrastructure. Using a variety of process mining techniques, we analyzed the processing of invoices sent by the various subcontractors and suppliers from three different perspectives: (1) the process perspective, (2) the organizational perspective, and (3) the case perspective. For this purpose, we used some of the tools developed in the context of the ProM framework. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of process mining in general and our algorithms and tools in particular.},

Studying large instances of such systems?such as free and open source software (FOSS) distributions?in terms of declared dependencies between packages is appealing. It is however also misleading when the language to express dependencies is as expressive as boolean formulae, which is often the case. In such settings, a more appropriate notion of component dependency exists: strong dependency. This paper introduces such notion as a first step towards modeling semantic, rather then syntactic, inter-component relationships. Furthermore, a notion of component sensitivity is derived from strong dependencies, with ap- plications to quality assurance and to the evaluation of upgrade risks. An empirical study of strong dependencies and sensitivity is presented, in the context of one of the largest, freely available, component-based system.},

This could enable new tools for developing code, encouraging reuse, and navigating large projects. In this paper, we build the first giga-token probabilistic language model of source code, based on 352 million lines of Java. This is 100 times the scale of the pioneering work by Hindle et al. The giga-token model is significantly better at the code suggestion task than previous models. More broadly, our approach provides a new "lens" for analyzing software projects, enabling new complexity metrics based on statistical analysis of large corpora. We call these metrics data-driven complexity metrics. We propose new metrics that measure the complexity of a code module and the topical centrality of a module to a software project. In particular, it is possible to distinguish reusable utility classes from classes that are part of a program's core logic based solely on general information theoretic criteria.},

Ownership and ownership awareness are also issues in open-source software (OSS) projects. Indeed, the membership in OSS projects is dynamic with team members arriving and leaving. In large open source projects, specialists who know the system very well are considered experts. How can one identify the experts in a project by mining a particular repository like the source code? Have they gotten help from other people? We provide an approach using classification of the source code tree as a path to derive the expertise of the committers. Because committers may get help from other people, we also retrieve their contributors. We also provide a visualization that helps to further explore the repository via committers and categories. We present a prototype implementation that describes our research using the Apache HTTP Web server project as a case study.},

Since engineers are connected by their shared work, a tool that discovers connections in their work-related repositories can help. Here we describe the Codebook framework for mining software repositories. It is flexible enough to address all of the problems identified by our survey with a single data structure (graph of people and artifacts) and a single algorithm (regular language reachability). Codebook handles a larger variety of problems than prior work, analyzes more kinds of work artifacts, and can be customized by and for end-users. To evaluate our framework's flexibility, we built two applications, Hoozizat and Deep Intellisense.

In Knowledge-intensive Processes (KiP), the discovery of such rules is a great challenge because they lack structure. In this context, this experimental study applies a decision mining technique in an event log of a real company that provides ICT infrastructure services. The log comprises structured data (ticket events) and non-structured data (messages exchanged among team members). The goal was to discover tacit decisions that could be potentially declared as business rules for the company. In addition to mining the decision points, we validated the discovered rule with the company w.r.t. their meaning.},

  abstract        = {Researchers in software engineering have attempted to improve software development by mining and analyzing software repositories. Since the majority of the software engineering data is unstructured, researchers have applied Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to help software development. The recent advances of IR, especially statistical topic models, have helped make sense of unstructured data in software repositories even more. However, even though there are hundreds of studies on applying topic models to software repositories, there is no study that shows how the models are used in the software engineering research community, and which software engineering tasks are being supported through topic models. Moreover, since the performance of these topic models is directly related to the model parameters and usage, knowing how researchers use the topic models may also help future studies make optimal use of such models. Thus, we surveyed 167 articles from the software engineering literature that make use of topic models. We find that i) most studies centre around a limited number of software engineering tasks; ii) most studies use only basic topic models; iii) and researchers usually treat topic models as black boxes without fully exploring their underlying assumptions and parameter values. Our paper provides a starting point for new researchers who are interested in using topic models, and may help new researchers and practitioners determine how to best apply topic models to a particular software engineering task.},

ClausIE fundamentally differs from previous approaches in that it separates the detection of ``useful'' pieces of information expressed in a sentence from their representation in terms of extractions. In more detail, ClausIE exploits linguistic knowledge about the grammar of the English language to first detect clauses in an input sentence and to subsequently identify the type of each clause according to the grammatical function of its constituents. Based on this information, ClausIE is able to generate high-precision extractions; the representation of these extractions can be flexibly customized to the underlying application. ClausIE is based on dependency parsing and a small set of domain-independent lexica, operates sentence by sentence without any post-processing, and requires no training data (whether labeled or unlabeled). Our experimental study on various real-world datasets suggests that ClausIE obtains higher recall and higher precision than existing approaches, both on high-quality text as well as on noisy text as found in the web.},

  abstract        = {Software evolution analysis provides a valuable source of information that can be used both to understand a system's design and predict its future development. While for many program comprehension purposes, it is sufficient to model a single version of a system, there are types of information that can only be recovered when the history of a system is taken into account. Logical coupling, the implicit dependency between software artifacts that have been changed together, is an example of such information. Previous research has dealt with low-level couplings between files, leading to an explosion of the data to be analyzed, or has abstracted the logical couplings to the level of modules, leading to a loss of detailed information. In this paper, we present a visualization-based approach that integrates logical coupling information at different levels of abstraction. This facilitates an in-depth analysis of the logical couplings, and at the same time, leads to a characterization of a system's modules in terms of their logical coupling. The presented approach supports the retrospective analysis of a software system and maintenance activities such as restructuring and redocumentation. We illustrate retrospective analysis on two large open-source software systems.},

  abstract = {Organizations increasingly initiate Internet-based innovation-contest communities through which individuals can interact and contribute to the innovation process. To successfully manage these communities, organizations need to understand what roles members assume, how they communicate and vary in their contribution behavior. In this exploratory study, we investigate the heterogeneous roles of contest participants based on an international innovation-contest community. We identify six user types associated with various behavioral contribution patterns by using cluster and social network analysis. The six user types further differ in their communicative content and contribution quality. Our paper contributes to a better theoretical understanding of distinctive user types in innovation-contest communities, their role in the community, and their contribution to the success of innovation contests in the era of social software. From a managerial perspective, the study provides guidance for contest platform design and appropriate reward structures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract        = {Distributed version control systems (D-VCSs —such as git and mercurial) and their hosting services (such as Github and Bitbucket) have revolutionalized the way in which developers collaborate by allowing them to freely exchange and integrate code changes in a peer-to-peer fashion. However, this flexibility comes at a price: code changes are hard to track because of the proliferation of code repositories and because developers modify (“rebase”) and filter (“cherry-pick”) the history of these changes to streamline their integration into the repositories of other developers. As a consequence, researchers and practitioners, who typically only consider the (cleaned up) history in the official project repository, are unaware of important elements and activities in the collaborative software development process. In this paper, we present a method that continuously mines all known D-VCSs of a software project to uncover the complete development history of a project. We use this method to (1) show the divergence between the code history development in the official Linux kernel repository and the complete kernel development history, and (2) to investigate the characteristics of the ecosystem of git repositories of the Linux kernel. Finally, we discuss how continuous mining could be adopted by current D-VCS hosting services.},

The mining software repositories (MSR) field analyzes and cross-links the rich data available in these repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems. By transforming these repositories from static record-keeping ones into active repositories, we can guide decision processes in modern software projects. For example, data in source control repositories, traditionally used to archive code, could be linked with data in bug repositories to help practitioners propagate complex changes and to warn them about risky code based on prior changes and bugs. In this paper, we present a brief history of the MSR field and discuss several recent achievements and results of using MSR techniques to support software research and practice. We then discuss the various opportunities and challenges that lie in the road ahead for this important and emerging field.},

The behavioral science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

Although the proper handling of temporal constraints is crucial in this context, existing PAISs vary significantly regarding their support of the temporal perspective of a business process. To make PAISs comparable with respect to their ability to deal with temporal constraints and to facilitate the development of a time-aware PAIS, this paper suggests 10 time patterns. All patterns are based on empirical evidence we gathered in case studies. Additionally, they are validated through a systematic literature review. Based on the time patterns, we then provide an in-depth evaluation of selected PAISs and academic approaches. Altogether, the 10 time patterns will not only facilitate the selection of technologies for realizing time- and process-aware information systems but can also be used as reference for implementing time support in PAISs.},

  abstract = {Context Prior research has established that a few individuals generally dominate project communication and source code changes during software development. Moreover, this pattern has been found to exist irrespective of task assignments at project initiation. Objective While this phenomenon has been noted, prior research has not sought to understand these dominant individuals. Previous work considering the effect of team structures on team performance has found that core communicators are the gatekeepers of their teams' knowledge, and the performance of these members was correlated with their teams' success. Building on this work, we have employed a longitudinal approach to study the way core developers' attitudes, knowledge sharing behaviors and task performance change over the course of their project, based on the analysis of repository data. Method We first used social network analysis (SNA) and standard statistical analysis techniques to identify and select artifacts from ten different software development teams. These procedures were also used to select central practitioners among these teams. We then applied psycholinguistic analysis and directed content analysis (CA) techniques to interpret the content of these practitioners' messages. Finally, we inspected these core developers' activities as recorded in system change logs at various points in time during systems' development. Results Among our findings, we observe that core developers' attitudes and knowledge sharing behaviors were linked to their involvement in actual software development and the demands of their wider project teams. However, core developers appeared to naturally possess high levels of insightful characteristics, which became evident very early during teamwork. Conclusions Project performance would likely benefit from strategies aimed at surrounding core developers with other competent communicators. Core developers should also be supported by a wider team who are willing to ask questions and challenge their ideas. Finally, the availability of adequate communication channels would help with maintaining positive team climate, and this is likely to mitigate the negative effects of distance during distributed developments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Role mining is to define a role set to implement the role-based access control (RBAC) system and regarded as one of the most important and costliest implementation phases. While various role mining models have been proposed, we find that user experience/perception-one ultimate goal for any information system-is surprisingly ignored by the existing works. One advantage of RBAC is to support multiple role assignments and allow a user to activate the necessary role to perform the tasks at each session. However, frequent role activating and deactivating can be a tendinous thing from the user perspective. A user-friendly RBAC system is expected to assign few roles to every user. So in this paper we propose to incorporate to the role mining process a user-role assignment constraint that mandates the maximum number of roles each user can have. Under this rationale, we formulate user-oriented role mining as the user role mining problem, where all users have the same maximal role assignments, the personalized role mining problem, where users can have different maximal role assignments, and the approximate versions of the two problems, which tolerate a certain amount of deviation from the complete reconstruction. The extra constraint on the maximal role assignments poses a great challenge to role mining, which in general is already a hard problem. We examine some typical existing role mining methods to see their applicability to our problems. In light of their insufficiency, we present a new algorithm, which is based on a novel dynamic candidate role generation strategy, tailored to our problems. Experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

Existing studies indicate that maintaining them is a distracting task, which costs a developer more than 30 min. a day. The goal of this research is to analyze the purposes of work descriptions, and find out if automated tools can assist developers in efficiently creating them. For this, we mine a large dataset of heterogeneous work descriptions from open source and commercial projects. We analyze the semantics of these documents and identify common information entities and granularity levels. Information on performed actions, concerned artifacts, references and new work, shows the work management purpose of work descriptions. Information on problems, rationale and experience shows their knowledge sharing purpose. We discuss how work description information, in particular information used for work management, can be generated by observing developers' interactions. Our findings have many implications for next generation software engineering tools.},

However, there is little research on how knowledge-sharing trajectories in temporary online crowds create innovative outcomes without these structures. Such research is particularly of interest in the context of temporary online crowds solicited with crowdsourcing in which there is only minimal structure for knowledge sharing. We identify eight types of crowdsourcing with different knowledge-sharing patterns. The focus of this study is on the one type of crowdsourcing?collaborative innovation challenges?in which there is the least restriction on knowledge sharing in the crowd. A content analysis was conducted of all time-stamped posts made in five different collaborative innovation challenges to identify different knowledge-sharing trajectories used. We found that a paradox-framed trajectory was more likely to be followed by innovative outcomes compared to three other knowledge-sharing trajectories. A paradox-framed trajectory is one in which a novel solution emerges when different participants post in the following sequence: (1) contributing a paradox associated with the problem objective, (2) sharing assumptions to validate the paradox, and (3) sharing initial ideas for resolving the paradox in a manner that meets the problem statement. Based on the findings, a theory of paradox-framed trajectories in temporary online crowds is presented along with implications for knowledge creation theories in general and online knowledge-creating communities in particular.},

While behavioural semantics of process models are well understood, there is a considerable gap of research into the semantic aspects of their text labels and natural language descriptions. The aim of this paper is to make this research gap more transparent. To this end, we clarify the role of textual content in process models and the challenges that are associated with the interpretation, analysis, and improvement of their natural language parts.

  abstract        = {Legacy systems include information and procedures which are fundamental to the organization. However, to maintain a legacy system is a complex and expensive task. Currently, researches propose the legacy systems reengineering using BPM and SOA. The benefits of the reengineering using BPM and SOA are software reuse and documentation of the business processes. However, practical experiences demonstrate that reengineering using BPM and SOA are not easy to apply, because there are no tools that help the developers understand the legacy system behavior. This paper presents a tool to extract the legacy system behavior. Based on the business rules concept, we propose a tool to identify the business rules contained legacy source code. In addition, our technique also enables the discovery of the partial order execution of the business rules during the runtime legacy system.},

  abstract        = {Logical dependencies are implicit relationships established between software artifacts that have evolved together. Software engineering researchers have investigated this kind of dependency to assess fault-proneness, detect design issues, infer code decay, and predict likely changes in code. Despite the acknowledged relation between logical dependencies and software quality, the nature of the logical dependencies is unknown in the literature. Most authors hypothesize about their origins, but no empirical study has been conducted to investigate the real nature of these dependencies. In this paper, we investigated the origins of logical dependencies by means of a case study involving a Java FLOSS project. We mined the project repository, filtered out irrelevant data based on statistical analyses, and performed a manual inspection of the logical dependencies to identify their origins using information from the revision comments, code diffs, and informal interviews held with the developers of the analyzed project. Preliminary results showed that logical dependencies involved files that changed together for a series of different reasons, which ranged from changing software license to refactoring classes that belonged to the same semantic class. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

  abstract        = {Abstract Background The laws of software evolution were formulated to describe time series trends in software over time. Objective Building on econometrics, the paper relates the laws theoretically to the concept of stationarity. The theoretical argumentation builds on the fact that in a stationary time series, the mean and variance remain constant. The concept is further elaborated with different statistical types of time series trends. These provide the objective for the empirical experiment that evaluates whether software size measures in a typical software evolution dataset are stationary. Method The time series analysis is based on conventional statistical tests for the evaluation of stationarity. Results The empirical dataset contains time series extracted from the version control systems used in Vaadin and Tomcat between circa 2006 and 2013. The results establish that the observed time series are neither stationary nor follow simple mathematical functions that would translate into stationarity. Conclusion The testing framework presented in the paper allows evaluating the stationarity of software evolution time series. The results can be interpreted theoretically against the laws of software evolution. These methodological and theoretical contributions improve the foundations of predictive time series modeling of software evolution problems. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Open Source Software (OSS) projects are no exception; in- deed, by design, the OSS approach can accommodate teams that are more open, geographically distributed, and dynamic than commercial teams. This, we find, leads to OSS teams that are quite diverse. Team diversity, predominantly in of- fline groups, is known to correlate with team output, mostly with positive effects. How about in OSS? Using GITHUB, the largest publicly available collection of OSS projects, we studied how gender and tenure diversity relate to team productivity and turnover. Using regression modeling of GITHUB data and the results of a survey, we show that both gender and tenure diversity are positive and significant predictors of productivity, together explaining a sizable fraction of the data variability. These results can inform decision making on all levels, leading to better out- comes in recruiting and performance. Author},

  abstract        = {AbstractEvaluation of design artefacts and design theories is a key activity in Design Science Research (DSR), as it provides feedback for further development and (if done correctly) assures the rigour of the research. However, the extant DSR literature provides insufficient guidance on evaluation to enable Design Science Researchers to effectively design and incorporate evaluation activities into a DSR project that can achieve DSR goals and objectives. To address this research gap, this research paper develops, explicates, and provides evidence for the utility of a Framework for Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) together with a process to guide design science researchers in developing a strategy for evaluating the artefacts they develop within a DSR project. A FEDS strategy considers why, when, how, and what to evaluate. FEDS includes a two-dimensional characterisation of DSR evaluation episodes (particular evaluations), with one dimension being the functional purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative) and the other dimension being the paradigm of the evaluation (artificial or naturalistic). The FEDS evaluation design process is comprised of four steps: (1) explicate the goals of the evaluation, (2) choose the evaluation strategy or strategies, (3) determine the properties to evaluate, and (4) design the individual evaluation episode(s). The paper illustrates the framework with two examples and provides evidence of its utility via a naturalistic, summative evaluation through its use on an actual DSR project.},

In order to allocate resources effectively, managers need to rely on their experience backed by code complexity metrics. But often dependencies exist between various pieces of code over which managers may have little knowledge. These dependencies can be construed as a low level graph of the entire system. In this paper, we propose to use network analysis on these dependency graphs. This allows managers to identify central program units that are more likely to face defects. In our evaluation on Windows Server 2003, we found that the recall for models built from network measures is by 10{\%} points higher than for models built from complexity metrics. In addition, network measures could identify 60{\%} of the binaries that the Windows developers considered as critical-twice as many as identified by complexity metrics.},
