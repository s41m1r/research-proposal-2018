abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors. Complex engineering projects, such as the deployment of a railway infrastructure or the installation of an interlocking system, involve human safety and make use of heterogeneous data sources, as well as customized engineering tools. These processes are currently carried out in an ad-hoc fashion, relying on the experience of experts who need to plan, control, and monitor the execution of processes for delivering value to the customers. This setting makes an automated overarching-process a crucial step towards supporting engineers and project managers to deal with safety-critical constraints and the plethora of details entailed by the process. This paper demonstrates a tool that combines methods from automatic reasoning, ontologies and process mining, implemented on top of a real Business Process Management System (BPMS).},

@incollection{Wolinski2018,
	abstract = {(a)                                          Situation faced: Siemens is a complex organization with offices worldwide. Through many years of development, it grew into a set of businesses, each with a substantial degree of autonomy, supported by central departments. This autonomy gives the departments the flexibility needed to achieve customer intimacy, which requires different process flows in different businesses. When the global initiative concerning the implementation of standard business process management was introduced and enacted, businesses were bundled into four sectors. Every sector in the Siemens organization, including that in Poland, was managing its processes according to the local business specifics and needs, which made the comprehensive process management approach challenging. The processes were disconnected and stored in multiple conventions. Corporate initiatives that were intended to address the effectiveness and efficiency of business processes were not supported.                                                                            (b)                                          Action taken: Siemens strengthened its process-wise approach and worldwide process standardization by implementing a formalized process policy. As a first step, the Business Process Excellence (BPE) regulation (also referred to as BPE policy) was introduced. It formulated the Siemens Processes for Excellence (SIPEX) process standards, which replaced the previous processes base, referred to as Reference Process House (RPH). At the same time, process roles (sponsor, owner, and manager) and corporate tools with which to visualize the processes, such as ARIS, were introduced. In the Polish organization, the program was formulated as a vehicle with which to implement the process organization. The goal of the initiative, which was referred to internally as “Streamlining business processes,” included chief financial officers (CFOs) as process sponsors and the head of the business process management team as the program manager.                                                                            (c)                                          Results achieved: At present, on the corporate level Business Excellence is a core element of Siemens—Vision 2020. It is embedded into the Corporate Technology structure, which enables it be the part of innovative products and management standards. It is also a key lever that empowers the company's lasting business success and strengthens its competitiveness in the market.                                                                            (d)                                          Lessons learned: From the implementation of the program we learned four primary lessons:                                                      Complexity in many dimensions (number of processes, number of roles, and number of formal documents and circulars) is not supportive of effective process management.                                                                                Having a strong, dedicated sponsor is one of the most important keys to success.                                                                                Not everyone in the organization will appreciate the effort at first, but they will if an attempt is made to understand their businesses and support their efforts.                                                                                Be flexible: without putting one's best effort into implementing the corporate recommendations and without alignment with the business, no appreciation or cooperation should be expected.                                                                                                                      },

abstract = {Companies working on safety-critical projects must adhere to strict rules imposed by the domain, especially when human safety is involved. These projects need to be compliant to standard norms and regulations. Thus, all the process steps must be clearly documented in order to be verifiable for compliance in a later stage by an auditor. Nevertheless, documentation often comes in the form of manually written textual documents in different formats. Moreover, the project members use diverse proprietary tools. This makes it difficult for auditors to understand how the actual project was conducted. My research addresses the project mining problem by exploiting logs from project-generated artifacts, which come from software repositories used by the project team.},

	abstract = {Large engineering processes need to be monitored in detail regarding when what was done in order to prove compliance with rules and regulations. A typical problem of these processes is the lack of control that a central process engine provides, such that it is difficult to track the actual course of work even if data is stored in version control systems (VCS). In this paper, we address this problem by defining a mining technique that helps to generate models that visualize the work history as GANTT charts. To this end, we formally define the notion of a project-oriented business process and a corresponding mining algorithm. Our evaluation based on a prototypical implementation demonstrates the benefits in comparison to existing process mining approaches for this specific class of processes. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

@inproceedings{Agrawal2016,
abstract = {Collaboration in business processes and projects requires a division of responsibilities among the participants. Version control systems allow us to collect profiles of the participants that hint at participants' roles in the collaborative work. The goal of this paper is to automatically classify participants into the roles they fulfill in the collaboration. Two approaches are proposed and compared in this paper. The first approach finds classes of users by applying k-means clustering to users based on attributes calculated for them. The classes identified by the clustering are then used to build a decision tree classification model. The second approach classifies individual commits based on commit messages and file types. The distribution of commit types is used for creating a decision tree classification model. The two approaches are implemented and tested against three real datasets, one from academia and two from industry. Our classification covers 86{\%} percent of the total commits. The results are evaluated with actual role information that was manually collected from the teams responsible for the analyzed repositories. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},
